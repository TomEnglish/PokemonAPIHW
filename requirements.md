Objective:
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of JavaScript Objects, the DOM, and asynchronous JavaScript by creating a simple web page that interacts with the PokeAPI to display basic Pokémon information. This exercise will help you practice fetching data from an API and dynamically updating the webpage.Instructions:
1. 
Create an input box where users can type the name or ID of a Pokémon.x
Add a button that triggers the search when clicked.x
Use the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data asynchronously. x
When the search is triggered, make an API request to retrieve the Pokémon's information.x
3. Display Data:
Display the Pokémon's name and image on the page after fetching the data.x
Update the DOM dynamically based on the API response. x
4. Basic Error Handling:
If the Pokémon is not found, display a simple error message. x
Bonus (Optional):
Display the Pokémon's type (e.g., Fire, Water) along with its name and image.x
Technical Requirements:
Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks). x
Fetch Pokémon data using the Fetch API or async/await. x
Dynamically update the DOM with the Pokémon data. x
Deliverables:
A working web page that allows users to search for a Pokémon and displays its name and image. x
Evaluation Criteria:
The app should successfully fetch and display Pokémon data.
Clean and readable code.
Simple, functional interface with appropriate feedback for invalid searches.
